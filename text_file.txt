Did you ever have a feeling there's a wasket in your basket?
Or a nureau in your bureau? Or a woset in your closet?
Sometimes I feel quite certain there's a jertain in the curtain
Sometimes I have a feeling there's a zlock behind the clock
And that zelf up on that shelf, I have talked to him myself
I said, that zelf up on that shelf, I have talked to him myself
That's the kind of house I live in, there's a nink up in the sink
And that zamp up in the lamp, and they're nice, I really think
And some of them are friendly like that yot up in the pot
But that yottle in the bottle, some are friendly, some are not
Like that zable on the table and that ghair under the chair
But that bofa on the sofa, well, I wish he wasn't there
And those nupboards in the cupboards, yeah they're fun to have about
But that noothgrush on my toothbrush, see, him I could do without
And the one I'm really scared of is that vug under the rug
Said the one I'm really scared of is that vug under the rug
And that quimney in the chimney, I don't like him at all
And it makes me kinda nervous when the zall scoots down the hall
And the yeps up on the steps, they are great to have around
There are many, many other other friends that I have found
There's the tellar and the nellar and the gellar and the dellar
And the bellar and the wellar and the zellar in the cellar
And that geeling on the ceiling and the zower in my shower
And the pillow on my zillow, I can talk to him for hours
I don't care if you believe it, that's the kinda house I live in
And I hope I never leave it, you can't come, you're forbidden
I don't care if you believe it, that's the kinda house I live in
And I hope I never leave it, you can't come, you're forbidden
